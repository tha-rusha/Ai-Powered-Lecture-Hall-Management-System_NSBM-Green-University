# 🏫 AI-Powered Lecture Hall Management System
### Data-Driven Scheduling, Resource Allocation & Demand Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a **Data-Driven and AI-Powered Lecture Hall Management System**, developed as a **Final Year Research Project** for the **BSc (Hons) in Management Information Systems (Special)** at **NSBM Green University**.

The system addresses inefficiencies in traditional lecture hall scheduling by introducing **predictive analytics**, **intelligent agents**, and **optimized allocation mechanisms** to improve responsiveness, efficiency, and utilization of university resources.

---

## 🎯 Research Objectives
- Identify key constraints in lecture hall scheduling (capacity, location, resources)
- Analyze limitations and gaps in existing systems such as **UMIS**
- Design and implement an AI-assisted scheduling prototype
- Improve lecture hall utilization and reduce scheduling conflicts
- Evaluate system performance using real university data

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement
Traditional university scheduling systems are largely rule-based, manual, or semi-automated. These approaches suffer from frequent timetable conflicts, underutilization of lecture halls, high administrative workload, and lack of demand forecasting.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
An **AI-powered lecture hall management platform** that predicts lecture hall demand using historical data, optimizes scheduling decisions, supports real-time adaptability, and provides visual analytics for administrators.

---

## 🧠 Core System Components
- Predictive Analytics Engine
- Genetic Algorithm Optimization Module
- Intelligent Agents for real-time adjustments
- Web-based dashboards for Admin, Lecturer, and Student roles

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
**Backend:** Python, Flask  
**Database:** MySQL  
**Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Chart.js
